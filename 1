MyApp is my first Ruby app on rails 3.1.
Reused gems: cucumber, devise, rspec.

Few hurdles that I had to google when developing:
    - arel 2.1.5 is buggy and causes error when running rake db:migrate
    - For rake 0.9.2, add require 'rake/dsl_definition' at the top in the RakeFile. Otherwise you get DSL error.
